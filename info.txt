We was delihted to read you're letter last week. Its always a plasure to recieve the ltest news and to hre that you and your family had a geat summer.We spent last week at the bach and had so muh fun on the snd and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that cme at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax. My kids are back in shool to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
